## 🚀 About Me  

I love turning ideas into performant web applications. Whether it’s crafting a responsive UI with React, building scalable APIs with Node.js or Go, or orchestrating containers with Docker & Kubernetes, I’m always chasing the next **‑‑ **_clean, maintainable, and fast_**‑‑** solution.  

I’m an active contributor to several open‑source libraries, a speaker at developer meet‑ups, and a mentor who believes that great code lives in great communities.
